# Q-5 leapYear

## Problem Statement
Write a program that checks whether a given year is a leap year. The program should follow specific rules to determine if a year is a leap year and store the result as a boolean value (true or false) in a variable named answer.

#### Check the following conditions to check if a given year is a leap year or not
Condition 1: If a year is divisible by 4, it is a leap year.

Condition 2: If a year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year.

Condition 3: If a year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year even though it is divisible by 100. 
Expected Input
2013
#### Expected Output
false
#### Expected Input
2004
#### Expected Output
true
#### Expected Input
2100
#### Expected Output
false

#### Test Cases
a-Check if a year is a leap year and store the boolean value in the answer
b-Check if a year is not a leap year and store the boolean value in the answer
c-Check if a year is divided by 4 but is not a leap year and store the boolean value in the answer

#### Additional Notes:
a. Pay attention to how the conditions are nested. Misplacing the if-else logic can lead to incorrect results.
b. Remember that true and false should be boolean values, not strings.

## JS Code
