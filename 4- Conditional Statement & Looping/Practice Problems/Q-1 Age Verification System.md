# Q-1 Age Verification System

## Problem Statement
Write a JavaScript function named checkEligibility that takes an integer input age and checks if the user's age meets the eligibility criteria. The function should return a string indicating whether access is "granted" or "denied" based on the following conditions:



1. If the user's age is 18 years or older, return "granted"

2. If the user's age is less than 18 years, return "denied"



**Expected Input**
- 17
**Expected Output**
- denied
**Expected Input**
- 22
**Expected Output**
- granted


**Hints:**
a-Use an if-else statement to check whether the age meets the eligibility criteria.

b- Make sure to test your function with different values to ensure it works correctly in all scenarios with the help of the "console.log". 

## JS Code
```
function checkEligibility(age) {
  let answer;
  //Write your code here
  return answer;
}

//for testing if the function is working properly
// console.log(checkEligibility(17));

```
## Modifications
Make necessary adjustments to the JS code to achieve the expected output.
