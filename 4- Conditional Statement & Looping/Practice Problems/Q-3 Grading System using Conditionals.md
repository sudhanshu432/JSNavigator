## Problem Statement
You are required to implement a grading system for a school based on the marks obtained by students in a test. The goal is to write a JavaScript program that determines the grade of a student using conditional statements.

#### The grades will be assigned in the result variable based on the following criteria:
1- If the value of the marks variable is greater than or equal to 90, the value of the result variable should be "A grade"
2- If the marks are between 80 and 89, the value of the result variable should be "B grade".
3- If the marks are between 70 and 79, the value of the result variable should be "C grade".
4- If the marks are between 60 and 69, the value of the result variable should be "D grade".
5- If the marks are less than 60, the value of the result variable should be "F grade".


#### Expected Input
89
#### Expected Output
B
#### Expected Input
93
#### Expected Output
A


#### Implementation Instructions:
1. Implement the conditional logic using a series of if-else if-else statements within a single block. This means you should start with an if condition, followed by one or more else if conditions, and conclude with an else condition. This structure ensures that only one block of code is executed based on the value of marks.
2. Avoid unnecessary re-declaration of variables within the if-else blocks.


#### Notes:
1- String Formatting: Ensure that the strings are correctly formatted using double quotes (" "). Avoid unnecessary extra quotes or misplaced brackets.
2- Conditional Operators: Pay attention to the correct use of comparison operators (>=, <=, &&). These are crucial for accurate grade determination.
3- Return Statement: The result variable should be returned after all conditions have been evaluated. Do not place the return statement inside any specific if-else block.
//Write a program to determine the grade of the student
//Determine the grade and assign it to the result variable.
//Do not alter anything else given in the starter code

function main(marks) {
  let result;
  //write your code here

  return result;
}


 

## JS Code
```
//Write a program to determine the grade of the student
//Determine the grade and assign it to the result variable.
//Do not alter anything else given in the starter code

function main(marks) {
  let result;
  //write your code here

  return result;
}

```
## Modifications
Make necessary adjustments to the JS code to achieve the expected output.
