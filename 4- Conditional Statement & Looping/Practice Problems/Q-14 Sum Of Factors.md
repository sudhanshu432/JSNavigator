# Q-14 Sum Of Factors

## Problem Statement
You are given a positive integer num. Your task is to calculate the sum of all its factors and store this sum in the variable answer. A factor is a number that divides num without leaving any remainder.

#### Expected Input
6
#### Expected Output
12
#### Explanation
The factor of 6 is 1,2,3,6 and their sum is 12


#### Hints:
1. Consider using a loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to num and check if each number is a factor of num.

2. Use an if statement inside the loop to determine if a number is a factor.

3. Keep a running total of the sum of the factors, and store the final result in the answe

## JS Code
```
function sumOfFactorial(num) {
    let answer = 0;

return answer;
}

```
## Modifications
Make necessary adjustments to the JS code to achieve the expected output.
