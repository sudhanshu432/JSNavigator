# Q-10 Compound Interest

## Problem Statement
Create a Compound Interest program that calculates the total amount accumulated after a certain period based on the following attributes:

a. principalAmount: The principal value deposited

b. annualInterestRate: Interest rate per year(expressed as a decimal).

c.  numberOfYears: Period for which interest has to be given.

#### Requirements
1. Calculate the total amount accumulated using the compound interest formula.
2. Do not use toFixed or round off the answer.
3. Use a while loop to calculate the total amount over the specified number of years.
4. Store the final amount in the answer variable. 

#### Sample Input
principalAmount : 500$
annualInterestRate : 0.08 (8% expressed as a decimal)
numberOfYears : 5

#### Sample Output
734.66

#### Test Cases
 - a- You must calculate the total amount accumulated based on the given attributes.
 - b- Store the final amount in the "answer" variable.

## JS Code
```
function compoundInterest(principalAmount, annualInterestRate, numberOfYears) {
  let answer;
  
  // Initialize the answer variable with the principal amount

  // create and initialize a year counter to 1

  // Use a while loop to calculate the total amount over the specified number of years

  // Return the final amount after all years
  return answer;
}

```
## Modifications
Make necessary adjustments to the JS code to achieve the expected output.
