# Q-6 Non Duplicate Array

## Problem Statement
You have been provided with two arrays your task is to merge both arrays while removing the duplicate elements from the merged array.

#### Expected Input
 arr1= [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
 arr2 = [5,6,7,8,9]
#### Expected Output
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
#### Note
The order of the elements should be preserved, i.e., The elements of the final array should be in the same order as they were present in the merging array.
#### Test Cases
Merge arr1 and arr2
Find all the duplicate elements from the new array and keep the order of the elements the same
Return the new array

//complete the function mergeArray
//Do not alter the starter code.
arr1 = [1,2,4,5,7];
arr2 = [3,4,6,7,9,0];

    //Implemet your function here
}
console.log(mergeArray(arr1,arr2));
//Output : [1,2,4,5,7,3,6,9,0]

```
