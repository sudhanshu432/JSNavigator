# Q-7 Sum of Array

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with creating a program that processes an array of positive integers. Your goal is to find the sum of all even numbers in the array, but you need to implement a special condition: if you encounter a number that is a multiple of 5, you should skip it and move on to the next element without including it in the sum.

#### Expected Input
[1,6,8,3,5,20,10]
#### Expected Output
14
#### Test Cases
Find all the even elements in the array
Omit those elements which are divisible by 5
Sum all the the elements which satisfy the given conditions
Return the sum

## JS Code
```
function sumOfArray(arr){
    let sum = 0;
}

```
## Modifications
Make necessary adjustments to the JS code to achieve the expected output.
