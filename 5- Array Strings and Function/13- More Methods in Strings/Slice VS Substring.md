In JavaScript, both slice() and substring() methods are used to extract a portion of a string, but they have some key differences in their behavior and usage. Here's a breakdown of the differences between the two:

## 1. Method Signatures
- **slice(startIndex, endIndex):**
    - Extracts a section of a string from startIndex to endIndex (not including the character at endIndex).
- **substring(startIndex, endIndex):**
    - Extracts characters from startIndex to endIndex (not including the character at endIndex), but the parameters can be swapped.

## 2. Handling Negative Indices
- **slice:**
    - If a negative index is provided, it counts from the end of the string. For example, str.slice(-2) will return the last two characters.
- **substring:**
    - If a negative index is provided, it treats it as 0. For example, str.substring(-2) will return the substring starting from index 0.
## 3. Parameter Order
- **slice:**
    - The order of parameters matters. slice(2, 5) will return the substring from index 2 to 4, while slice(5, 2) will return an empty string.
- **substring:**
    - The order of parameters does not matter. Both substring(2, 5) and substring(5, 2) will return the substring from index 2 to 4.
## 4. Return Values
- Both methods return a new string and do not modify the original string.

## 5. Examples
Here are some examples to illustrate the differences:

```
let str = "Hello, World!";

// Using slice
console.log(str.slice(7, 12));      // Output: "World"
console.log(str.slice(-6));          // Output: "World!"
console.log(str.slice(12, 7));       // Output: "" (empty string)

// Using substring
console.log(str.substring(7, 12));   // Output: "World"
console.log(str.substring(-6));       // Output: "Hello, " (starts from index 0)
console.log(str.substring(12, 7));    // Output: "World" (the order of parameters doesn't matter)

```

## 5. Examples
- Use slice() when you want to extract a part of a string with the flexibility of negative indices and when the order of indices matters.
- Use substring() when you want a simpler approach where the order of parameters doesnâ€™t matter and negative values are treated as zero.

Both methods are useful, and the choice between them depends on your specific needs in string manipulation.
