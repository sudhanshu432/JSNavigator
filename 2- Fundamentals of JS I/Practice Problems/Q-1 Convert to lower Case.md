# Convert to lower Case

## Problem Statement
Write a program that converts every character of the user name as lowercase and combines the first name and last name of the user.

You have given the first name and last name of the user as the input. The names of the users should be stored in lowercase only and the output should be a combination of both First name and Last name.

Input:-
firstName: “JOHN”
lastName: “DOE”


Expected Output:-
Username: johndo

## Test Cases

- a- You have to take firstName as 'JOHN' and lastName as 'DOE'. After applying the required method the output should come as 'johndoe
## JS Code
```
function lowerCaseString(str1,str2){
    let answer;
// You have been provided with two strings
//Str1="JOHN"
//Str2 = "DOE"
//"You need to convert str1 and str2 to lowercase, concatenate them together, and store the concatenated string in the variable 'answer'."
    

    return answer;
}

```
## Modifications
