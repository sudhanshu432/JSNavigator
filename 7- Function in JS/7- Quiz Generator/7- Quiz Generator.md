# 7- Quiz Generator

## Problem Statement
You have been assigned the task of developing a software system for an online examination that generates question papers for various subjects. The system should be able to shuffle the questions within each subject every time a question paper is generated, ensuring that the order of the questions is randomized for each student.


#### Requirements

Develop a function named **"shuffle"** that accepts an array as its input.
This function should return another function.
The returned function should be able to produce a shuffled version of the original array whenever it is called.
You have the flexibility to choose a meaningful name for the returned function.

#### Input:

const func = shuffle(questions)

const shuffledArray1 = func();

const shuffledArray2 = func();



#### Output:

- shuffleArray1 : [ 'Question5', 'Question3', 'Question1', 
'Question4', 'Question2' ]
- shuffleArray2 : [ 'Question3', 'Question1', 'Question4', 
'Question5', 'Question2' ]
